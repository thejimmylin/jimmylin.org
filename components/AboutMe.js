      <H1>Hello world</H1>
      <P>
        I&apos;m Jimmy. I love programming. I like to create things and
        programming gives me the chance to do so.
      </P>
      <P>
        I have five years of programming experience, mostly in{" "}
        <A href="https://www.python.org/">Python</A> and web development.
      </P>
      <H1>Skills</H1>
      <P>Here are my skills and the techniques I use:</P>
      <H2>Python</H2>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.python.org/">Python</A> is my primary programming
        language. I am familiar with Python&apos;s language features and many of
        its standard libraries such as{" "}
        <A href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</A>
        , <A href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html">
          logging
        </A>{" "}
        and <A href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html">shlex</A>,
        etc. I care about code quality, following{" "}
        <A href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</A>
         and many other code style conventions. I follow the{" "}
        <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</A>. I keep
        my code clean, modular and reusable.
      </P>
      <H2>Django</H2>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</A> is a Python&apos;s
        web framework I&apos;ve spent most of my time with. I&apos;ve been doing
        web development with Django for over 5 years. I can build modern,
        well-tested web application with it.
      </P>
      <H2>Django REST Framwork</H2>
      <P>
        Django is pretty good, but when you combine it with 
        <A href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">
          Django REST Framework
        </A>
        , it gets even better. Modern web applications often require REST APIs,
        and this is where the Django REST Framework comes in.
      </P>
      <H2>SQL</H2>
      <P>
        Django has a great model/ORM system, which makes it possible to creating
        a web application without writing SQL. But sometimes SQL knowledge is
        important, too. It is true especially when it comes to a extremely
        complicated queriy or some performance issue.
      </P>
      <H2>React.js / Next.js</H2>
      <P>
        Now, when it comes to frontend things, 
        <A href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</A> is my favorite. Its
        philosophy is so graceful, making you enjoy coding and building things
        with it. This website is built with React.js, too.{" "}
        <A href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</A> gives me a lot of things out
        of the box. It lets me not worry about the 
        <A href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching">
          SSG/SSR
        </A>
         things, which is pretty annoying to implement on our own.
      </P>
      <H2>Vue.js</H2>
      <P>
        In addition to React.js, I also use 
        <A href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</A>. I personally like React.js
        more, but they are both very powerful andd reliable frameworks.
      </P>
      <H2>Tailwind CSS</H2>
      <P>
        <A href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</A> is another tool that
        I love and use a lot. It is similar to 
        <A href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</A>, but it is much more
        flexible and easy to customize, which prevents you from building a lot
        of similar web.
      </P>
      <H2>HTML / CSS / JavaScript</H2>
      <P>
        In addition to developing with frontend frameworks, I also know about
        HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I think, after all, frameworks are based on these
        three elements, so it is important to have a solid understanding of
        them.
      </P>
      <H2>GitHub Actions</H2>
      <P>
        I use <A href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">Github actions</A> to
        handle CI/CD things. I believe that deployment is just as important as
        development. If a feature can&apos;t be delivered to the users, the
        resources spent on development will be wasted.
      </P>
      <H2>Docker</H2>
      <P>
        I mostly run my services in <A href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</A>
        , which frees me from a lot of environment and compatibility concerns.
        Docker greatly increases the portability and flexibility of the
        services.
      </P>
      <H2>GCP</H2>
      <P>
        <A href="https://cloud.google.com/gcp">GCP</A> is where most of my
        services are hosted. This website is such a example. I usually use their
        compute engines with Docker.
      </P>
